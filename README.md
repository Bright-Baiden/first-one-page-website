Aspiring to be a web developer.
This is my journey.
I know it is not going to be easy considering how difficult it is to even land your first tech job offer but I'm not going to waiver.
Will keep leaarning and practising till I get better and even then I won't stop learning.
It obvious I am new to all this so please if you ever do come across my profile and you have any advice to give me, please do reach out
